Dual Boot [Ubuntu & Windows]

Implementation:
We had given a task to install the Ubuntu operating system on dual boot alongside Windows 10. The steps we follow in below.
    • Downloaded Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS .iso file, which is the latest version of ubuntu.
    • Using Rufus 3.18, we create a USB bootable pen drive.
    • We allocated some free space from our hard disk for installing Ubuntu.
    • Then we restarted our PC and selected install ubuntu from the boot menu.
    •  We had to boot manually from BIOS/UEFI.
    • Then we followed some procedure
Install Ubuntu       Keyboard Layout	       Normal installation        Install Ubuntu alongside windows	   Select Time Zone
    • After that, we create a User Account.
    • Finally, the Ubuntu installing completed. Then we had to restart our PC removing the USB pen drive. 
Hindrance & Overcome:
For installing Ubuntu we faced some problems. Here we discuss the problem and its solving.
    • For allocating memory we do not have free spaces. So, we need to shrink a volume or delete a volume.
    • After restarting PC did not automatically go to the boot menu. So, manually we have to press the F12 button from the keyboard.
Advantage:
Let's take a look at the advantages of using ubuntu.
    • User-friendly
    • Totally free of cost
    • It's secure. Say no to the anti-virus.
    • Highly customizable
    • Supportive Ubuntu community
    • Low system requirements
    • It's open-source
    • Tons of free software

Configuring Git on Ubuntu
Implementation:
After installing Ubuntu we have to install git and configure the git profile. We have to follow some steps from the Ubuntu terminal. Those are shown below.
    • sudo apt install git
    • git --version
    • git config --global user.name “istyaque-ahammed”
    • git config --global user.email “istyaque2040@cseku.ac.bd”
    • git config --list
Then we need to show check-in and check-out on git. Here we also followed some steps on the Ubuntu terminal.
Check-in:
    • git init
    • git status
    • git add Istyaque.txt
    • git commit --m “First git file”
    • git push origin master
    • Verifying user id and password.
 Check-Out:
    • git init
    • git clone git@github.com:istyaque-ahammed.git
    • git pull origin master
    • Verifying user id and password.
Hindrance & Overcome:
For doing this task we had to face several problems. Problems are discussed below.
    • We faced a password authentication problem. So, we used a personal token generator to solve the problem. Then we access it with a token. 

Drawbacks:
We have to write so many codes to perform anything. It took a lot of time. We have to memorize all code for each performance. We have to do the same things again and again.

Thank You
